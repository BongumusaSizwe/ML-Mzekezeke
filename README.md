# Ubani uMzekezeke? 
This is a question that battles most South Africans, and there is even a song of the same title by Mzekeze which means "Who is Mzekezeke?".


Mzekezeke is a skilled masked musician, that many people have made their guesses on who he is. Most people assume Mzekezeke is Dj Sbu, a businessman, artist and a public figure. 
To this day, Dj Sbu denies this claim. 


In this project I intend to use machine learning techniques to confirm or deny that Mzekezeke is indeed Dj Sbu. 


This question can be formulated into a statistical question, using hypothesis testing. 
## Hypothesis 
### Null Hypothesis: Dj Sbu is Mzekezeke
### Alternative Hypothesis: Dj Sbu is not Mzekezeke
